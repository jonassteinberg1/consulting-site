# Site Design Notes

## Goals

- customer comes, immediately knows which services we offer, is able
  to then dive deeper into each service and is also served with contact
  information constantly

- fully repsonsive across desktop, tablet, tablet portrait and mobile

## Core Design Desires

- core services are offered on the hero image so that you immediately see what we offer
  - they are clickable and redirect to a component that goes more in depth and offers contact

- contact information below hero

- navbar replicates hero workflow

- html5up.net has some that will work
  - replace burger w/ navbar
    - https://html5up.net/phantom
    - https://html5up.net/forty
    - https://html5up.net/dimension
    - https://html5up.net/aerial
